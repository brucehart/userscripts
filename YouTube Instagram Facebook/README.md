# Disable Page Visibility (IG / YouTube / Facebook)

This userscript forces the Page Visibility API to always report that the page is visible so videos keep playing even when you switch tabs. It also stops `visibilitychange` events from reaching page scripts. It applies to YouTube (mobile and desktop), Instagram and Facebook.

## Installation

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension in your browser.
2. Open the raw script file: [`Disable Page Visibility-1.0.user.js`](./Disable%20Page%20Visibility-1.0.user.js).
3. Tampermonkey will prompt you to add the script. Confirm the installation.
4. Visit YouTube, Instagram or Facebook and switch tabs to keep videos playing in the background.
