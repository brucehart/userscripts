# Userscripts

This repository contains a collection of userscripts designed for use with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Userscripts are small pieces of JavaScript that can modify or enhance websites directly in your browser. They run after a page loads and can add new features, automate tasks or change the look and feel of a site.

## What is Tampermonkey?

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a popular browser extension that allows you to install and manage userscripts. It is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and other browsers. Once installed, Tampermonkey provides an interface to enable, disable and edit individual scripts.

## Installing Tampermonkey

1. Visit the [Tampermonkey download page](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser.
2. Choose the appropriate version for your browser (e.g. Chrome Web Store for Chrome users, Add-ons page for Firefox, etc.).
3. Install the extension and accept any prompts that your browser displays.

After installation you should see the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar.

## Using the scripts in this repository

1. Click on any of the `*.user.js` files in this repository to open the raw script.
2. Your browser will detect that you have Tampermonkey installed and will prompt you to install the script.

4. Visit the site specified in the `@match` section of the script header (for example, the Yahoo Fantasy Football pages for the scripts in the `Yahoo Fantasy Football` directory).
